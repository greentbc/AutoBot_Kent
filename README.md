# AutoBot_Kent
Autonomous robot project I started while at Kent State University.

### Outline
This is code for an autonomous robot. It relies a Ultrasonic sonar sensor for obstacle avoidance. Two infrared proximity sensors are used for line tracking and maneuvering printed tracks. Wheel speed is measured using optocouplers and used to compensate for the low reliability of the wheel motors. SDR_tcp2serial.py can be used to with something like a Raspberry Pi send telemetry data via TCP.

Images of the tracks and video of the robot are in the media folder.
